/**
 * The merge-time settle: recompute the resting layout from the CURRENT
 * graph + the positions ledger, and replace the ledger. Called by the
 * extraction pipeline after every merge (the sole writer) and by the
 * positions-commit endpoint when the graph grew under a live-physics
 * commit (client positions become the anchor set). Synchronous — it must
 * finish before the next /api/graph fetch reflects the change.
 *
 * CHAINS-PRIMARY (owner, 2026-09-30): the settle lays out the DERIVED
 * view — propositions AND the derived implication nodes (one per chain,
 * arg_ ids) over the derived untyped arrows — so positions exist for
 * every node the canvas renders. Implication nodes participate in the
 * physics as regular nodes (rendering specialization comes later).
 *
 * SPLIT FROM layout.ts deliberately (2026-09-13): layout.ts is in the
 * browser barrel, and the settle needs the cluster partition for the
 * cluster centroid pull — this module must not ship in the client bundle.
 * Server code imports it DIRECTLY; it is never re-exported through
 * src/core/index.ts.
